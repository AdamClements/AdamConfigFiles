Slime-style navigation for Emacs Lisp
=====================================

Slime allows very convenient navigation to the symbol at point (using
M-.), and the ability to pop back to previous marks (using M-,).

This plugin provides similar navigation for Emacs Lisp, supporting
navigation to the definitions of variables, functions, libraries and
faces.

Installation
============

Ensure elisp-slime-nav.el is in a directory on your load-path, and
add the following to your ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el

  (require 'elisp-slime-nav)
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (elisp-slime-nav-mode t)))
