;;; Commentary:

;; Based ac-slime

;;; Installation:

;; Available as a package in both Melpa (recommended) at
;; http://melpa.milkbox.net/ and Marmalade at http://marmalade-repo.org/
;; M-x package-install ac-nrepl

;;; Usage:

;;     (require 'ac-nrepl)
;;     (add-hook 'nrepl-mode-hook 'ac-nrepl-setup)
;;     (add-hook 'nrepl-interaction-mode-hook 'ac-nrepl-setup)
;;     (eval-after-load "auto-complete"
;;       '(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'nrepl-mode))

;; If you want to trigger auto-complete using TAB in nrepl buffers, you may
;; want to use auto-complete in your `completion-at-point-functions':

;;     (defun set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function ()
;;       (setq completion-at-point-functions '(auto-complete)))
;;     (add-hook 'auto-complete-mode-hook 'set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function)
;;
;;     (add-hook 'nrepl-mode-hook 'set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function)
;;     (add-hook 'nrepl-interaction-mode-hook 'set-auto-complete-as-completion-at-point-function)
